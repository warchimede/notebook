# Ultimate Productivity

## Introduction
### Take care of your health
- Quality and enough sleep
- Pay attention to the diet
- Physical exercise

### Practice Consistency
- Practice every day
- If necessary, sacrifice quality and quantity for the sake of consistency (don’t miss a day)

### Live a 24-hour life
- Make a plan for a longer period of time, but think and act only in a span of one single day

### Invest in the Constructive Side of Your Personality
Every day, you have a choice :
- Whether invest time in procrastination
- Or invest in delivering results, return on investment.

### Stop Hyping Yourself up Before Sleep
- Wake up and go from there. One thing at the time. 

### Take Notes
- Write things down
- Evaluate every week
- Adapt strategy if necessary

### The starting point
- What makes a person incredibly successful is that they have learned how to use their time efficiently and have created a habit out of it. 
- We all have 24 hours within a day. 

## Phase one: Direction
### Goal setting
- Focus on one year ahead, set one primary goal and couple of secondary ones.
- Make your goals specific, and phrase them in a way as if you have already achieved them.

### High Leverage Activities
- First, list down everything that can help achieve the goals.
- Ask yourself three questions:

1. If I had few hours a day to commit to my goal which item on the list would add the most value, and help me get closer to my goal?
2. If I could do one more thing on the list, which item would deliver the best results?
3. Finally, if I could do just one more thing, what would that be?

### High Leverage Skills
- Define what skills to learn to accomplish the high leverage activities, and thus the goals.

### The Ideal Day
To start taking control of the day, design it.

A few helping questions :
• When do you wake up?
• What do you do in your morning ritual?
• What’s your most important goal and what do you need to do today to get closer to it?
• How many hours per day do you want to work?
• How does your working space look like?
• How do you get in the state of flow?
• Who are the people that you spend most time with? Family? Friends? Your Partner?
• What hobbies do you have? Reading? Dancing?
• What do you do before going to bed? What’s your ritual?
• Finally, how do you feel throughout the day?

## Phase two: Elimination
### Personal Time Assessment
- Assess how much time is spent on each daily activity per week
- Add everything for the weekly total
- Subtract 168 (number of hours in a week) with weekly total
- -> Evaluate time wasters

### Tracking Time & Evaluating Results
Once per week, ask these questions:
- When was I most productive? At what hour?
- What made me productive?
- When was I unproductive? At what hour?
- What made me unproductive ? How can I improve this?

### The Procrastination List & The Cost of Procrastination
Answer these questions:
- What are the activities you procrastinate the most on?
- What cost does/will it have on your health, finances, stress, social life if you continue procrastination ?
- What would happen if you stop procrastinating?

### Procrastinate on Procrastination
Whenever the urge to indulge in any activity that doesn’t support the habit/goal comes, just postpone the urge for one day.

If the urge comes again, ask these questions:
- Does this activity support my habit/goal?
- Does this activity make it harder for me to establish this habit/to achieve this goal?

Repeat the process the next day.

### The Procrastination Pyramid
Deconstruct a high leverage activity into more manageable mini activities.

Then just go through each one, one at a time.

### The 2-Minute Rule
If it takes less than two minutes to complete, do it right away.

### Implement The X Method
Take a calendar, for each day that you do you habit, put a X on that day.
Don’t break the chain.

## Phase Three: Optimization
### Specify and List The Most Repetitive Activities

### Outsource
What activity takes a lot of time, but doesn’t cost too much to outsource to someone?

### Bulk up the Tasks
Dedicate a specific time of the week to do all the chores (groceries, cleaning, ..).

### Optimize Eating Habits
On Sundays, allocate 20min to plan the weekly meals.

### Reclaim Dead Time
Do something of value while performing items that you already are committed to spending time on and don’t require mental engagement.

### Say No to Things That Are Not Supporting Your Goals
Remember that you are not saying NO to others, you are saying YES to yourself.

## Phase Four: Execution
### Design a Morning Routine
- To wake up early, move the waking up hours gradually.
- Take naps when a drop of energy occurs
- Five things to achieve in the morning:
	- Become alert
	- Take care of emotional state
	- Take care of intellectual growth
	- Take care of health
	- Work on long-term goals

#### Get a Small Win
#### Drink Water
#### Meditate
#### Read or Consume a Course
#### Exercise
#### Set the Priorities for the Day
#### Say NO to Email & Social Media until the Morning Routine is finished

### Transition to a Daily Routine
#### Block Time aka Schedule Meetings with Yourself
Focus without disruptions on the high leverage activities.

#### Declutter Your Environment
Simple environment that contains only the items needed for the task.

#### Organize Your Computer
- Delete everything not needed
- Don’t open ten apps/browser tabs at the same time.

#### Use Productivity Tools & Apps

#### Eliminate, Delegate, Automate
Run the activities that are not high leverage through three filters:
1. Can any be eliminated ?
2. Can the remaining be delegated ?
3. Can the rest be automated ?

#### Ditch the Perfectionism
Launch when it’s good enough and improve.

#### Master the State of FLOW
Analyze what puts you in THE ZONE.

#### Work in Bursts
Use the Pomodoro Technique

#### Take Breaks
Stand up, stretch, drink water, interact, take a walk.

#### Take Naps

#### When Stuck, Change your Environment

#### Implement Buffer Time
Always schedule a certain amount of time of buffer in case something does not go according to plan.

#### Say NO to Meetings without a specific outcome, structure and key stakeholders defined

### Develop an Evening Routine
#### Stop using Technology before Sleep Time
1 hour before, meditate.

#### Prepare for the Next Day
Three things to think about:
- Top priorities for the next day
- Clothes to wear
- Meals to eat

Things to always ask yourself:
- What worked today ?
- What kind of progress did I make ?
- What am I grateful for ?

Picture your ideal day.
