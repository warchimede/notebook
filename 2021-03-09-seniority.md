# Seniority

- Memorizing API's doesn't matter
- Learn time management
- Open source the tools you write
- Write about things

> What matters is not the title you hold, but what you represent.

> There are no stupid questions, and if people are asking about your code it means it can be improved.

## Personal Principles

To be considered a senior, you have to be:

### Reliable

Never promise something you cannot deliver.
It's better so over-deliver after a safe estimate.

### Accountable

Let the others know when you make mistakes or need help.

### Flexible

Embrace change, challenge yourself and you assumptions.
Have side-projects to test other frameworks or languages.
Fight endowment bias, stating the we value things we own or know more than they are worth.

### Pragmatic

Don't just focus on the engineering side of things, delivering things matters.
Understand the business requirements, do not write code for the sake of code.

## Working with Others

Be a team player.

### Lead by example

- Be proactive
- Always look for ways to improve the architecture and tooling
- Teach and pair program, help out
- Treat everyone as an equal conversation partner

### Listen and learn from others

- Be open to other and new opinions, discuss them to better understand things
- Do not leverage your "power" or "seniority"
- Use factual arguments in a debate
- Avoid being reactive, pause and think before replying
- Don't interrupt others, and make sure that people who were interrupted can speak their mind

### Be a mentor

- Foster the right team culture
- Be accessible
- Help others grow

### Actively look for ways to improve the process

- Before criticizing, always find alternatives
- Find solutions to the pain points, when a pattern emerges

### Have the courage to fight for a healthy team culture

- Speak up when someone is misbehaving
- If you're willing to quit a toxic environment, why not fight for it ?
