# Newton's  Laws of Productivity

1. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Find a way to get started in less than 2 minutes.
2. It's not about working hard, it's also about working on the right things. You have a limited amount of force and where you apply it matters.
3. Your productivity is a balance of opposing forces. If you want to be more productive, you can either power through the barriers or remove the opposing forces. The second seems to be less stressful.
