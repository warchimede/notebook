# Persuading the Unpersuadable

## Ask a know-it-all to explain how things work

It lets them recognize gaps in their own understanding

## Let a stubborn person seize the reins

Don't give them the full idea, just plant seeds of the concept and let them grow it. Inception.

Don't tell you boss what to do, instead ask questions: "What if?", "Could we?"

## Find the right way to praise a narcissist

Praise people in an area different from the one in which you hope to change their minds.

## Disagree with the disagreeable

Show that you're not a yes-man but that you're willing to fight for your ideas.
