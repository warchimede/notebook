# The Software Craftsman

## Software Development in the Twenty-First Century
- Seniority: not measured by how complicated code one can produce

## Agile
- During agile transformation, many companies focus on the processes and forget technical practices
- Also improving technical excellence is fundamental
--> Software Craftsmanship

## Software Craftsmanship
- Professionalism in software development
- Striving to always do the best and provide good service
- It's a mindset, a lifestyle to adopt and to be committed to

## The Software Craftsmanship Attitude
- Own the career. Be confident.
- Determination, passion and focus are essential
- Stay up to date, learn and PRACTICE
- Time is not an excuse, we choose how we spend it

## Heroes, Goodwill, And Professionalism
- Trying to be a hero is not professional
- Being pro and satisfying clients does not mean doing everything they ask
- We need to help figure out what the real need is, give the best way to approach the problem. 
- Have ethics and a code of conduct
- Be honest and transparent about the problems. Always and early
- Never do something harmful to the client, even when he asks for it
- We have to say NO when necessary
- Inform when deadlines cannot be met
- Act like a good lawyer or doctor: clients don't tell you how to do your job.
- Always provide options

## Working Software
- Neglecting software quality in order to go faster is an illusion
- The worse it is, the harder it will be to make changes, the slower the company will be to react to changes

## Technical Practices
- Before talking about adopting practices (such as TDD, continuous integration, refactoring, pair programming, ...), we should discuss what we want to achieve

## The Long Road
A few things we can do to create opportunities:
- Expand our technical knowledge, studying things out of our comfort zone, like new languages and technologies
- Attend User Groups and tech community events
- Network with other developers and businesspeople
- Blog about the things we are learning and doing
- Contribute to open source projects
- Develop projects and make them publicly available
- Attend conferences
- Present at a conference

Knowledge is forever; money, stability, and security are not.

In each job, a software craftsman should look for autonomy, mastery, purpose.
The better we are, the easier it is to find jobs that will give us pleasure.
First, we need a lot of focus and determination while crafting our careers.
Our own career is more important than a career inside a company. Jobs are investments. Choose carefully. Always strive to satisfy customers. This is the way to create a successful career.
