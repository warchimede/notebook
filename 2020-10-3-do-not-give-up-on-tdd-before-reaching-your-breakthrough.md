# Donâ€™t Give Up on TDD Before Reaching Your Breakthrough

## TDD lives in a system of design
TDD is hard. To do TDD well, we need:
-   To design code that is testable, using SOLID principles and the likes
-   To express requirements in code, each test lays down a new constraint, they should triangulate a solution

TDD depends on having fast, executable tests.

## TDD lives in a system of feedback
TDD is part of a larger approach called Extreme Programming. Gaining feedback is a core value/principle/rule.

For the playing / experimentation / non-linear exploration part, the answer is Spike Solutions.

A Spike Solution is hacking to answer:
-   Are we building the right thing ?
-   How do we build this thing ?

The final step is to throw away the code of the Spike solution

## Why throw away code before starting TDD?
The goal of answering questions is reached, the knowledge should be kept somewhere.

BUT TESTS WERE NOT WRITTEN. Also, with TDD, design will emerge gradually, and the code will adapt more easily to new circumstances.
